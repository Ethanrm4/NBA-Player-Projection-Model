This model leverages NBA data from the 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23 seasons to forecast player Win Shares for the 2023-24 season. The report is presented as if I were a member of the Utah Jazz Analytics department, where I would use the model's valuations to make decisions on player acquisitions in free agency, re-signing current players, or cutting players from the team.

The datasets were obtained from Basketball-Reference.com or the R package (hoopR).
